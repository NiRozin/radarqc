Some radar data has not complete data in bins dimension.
So, if your radar file is not with full matrix (shape is not equal nbins) the function will
be complete.

*This script will be in use temporarily.

How to use
In order to use, in your pyart folder, you need replace the /aux_io/odim_h5.py by this one.
Don't be afraid, all pyart functions will be fine with this.
